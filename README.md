This mod lets you easily pickup villagers and place them back at anywhere. You have to craft a villager globe that takes
a glass block and a pressure plate to make. Just shift-right-click to a villager while you have one, and you'll take the
villager to inside the globe. Once you place the globe again, the villager will break the glass and leave.
